# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
    
    Team members will meet one to two times a week, depending on the amount of problems that will be addressed during the meeting. Meeting times of that week will be decided on the weekend. The meetings will be held on zoom or in person (reserve a study room if it is the case). Each meeting should last one to two hours. There will be one person taking notes about the key points discussed during the meeting, and team members will be sharing progress of their works and discussing their difficulties. Members will be discussing plans for future weeks as well, and making adjustments based on the progress. In case of urgent issues, there will be additional meetings held for that week.

2. **Assistance** 
    
    Members can contact each other through WeChat or discord. Members can also contact each other through text messages or voice calls. Members should reply within 24 hours. If needed, members will email the mentor asking for help.

3. **Respect** 
    
    Since our team size is relatively small, each member’s contribution is greatly appreciated and will be recognized. It’s a consensual courtesy that all team members will not disrespectfully interrupt the other when she’s expressing her thoughts, and we will provide our honest feedback to each other. Since each member needs to share their progress of the week, everyone will have an opportunity to speak.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

    The work will be distributed for each member based on their strengths during the meetings. Members will try their best to have their workload equally distributed. If there are unexpected complications or unforeseen work, members will be holding additional meetings discussing them and solving them together. In case that no one in the team has any ideas toward the situation, the team will ask help from the mentor. 

5. **Time Commitment** 

    Each group member is expected to spend at least three hours per week completing their parts of the project. It is everyone’s responsibility to finish their assigned work before each meeting. If they encounter any problem, all team members will need to solve it together or ask help from the mentor. When someone misses a meeting due to health or any unexpected problems, it is everyone’s responsibility to inform others. Each meeting will be recorded and given to those who miss the meeting. 
6. **Conflict Resolution** 

    We will make agreements on the timing of working together and having weekly meetings in advance. While we have trust to each other that all members will be responsible for this group project and each one’s individual tasks, in case of hypothetical situations such as one or more members have not accomplished their task, we will enforce some rules between groups: that team member should make up their missing work before a soft deadline that all other members can accept. In case of disagreement between members, we encourage members with different opinions to debate about their reasoning, and let the minority obey the majority. If any member is habitually late for several times even after kindly reminders from other teammates, it is time to inform the mentor about the situation.
